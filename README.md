# Mobile-Price-Predictor

Web-based application that predicts the price of the laptop according to the configuration input by user.
The project includes heavy data preprocessing, manipulation, and feature engineering. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was also conducted to gain insights into the data. After testing both machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we decided to use the Random Forest algorithm as our final model.





# File Description

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is 'mobile_data.csv'. It contains information about various smart phones such as **brand, screen size, processor, RAM, ROM, battery, camera, colour** and **price**. The dataset required extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and **one-hot encoding**.
## Performance
ML Algorithm used -  Random Forest Regression 

1.	**R2 Score -** 0.9278 **=** 92.78%
2.	**Mean Absolute Error -** 1791.92
